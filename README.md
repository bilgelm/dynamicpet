_Dynamic PET_ is designed for voxelwise analysis of reconstructed dynamic
positron emission tomography (PET) scans.
_Dynamic PET_ also supports regional analysis.

Methods implemented include:

- Denoising
  - HYPR-LR
- Reference tissue-based kinetic modeling
  - SRTM

_Dynamic PET_ provides a command line interface (CLI) for easy image processing and also a Python API with greater flexibility.

## Requirements

_Dynamic PET_ requires Python 3.11+ and the following modules:
`numpy` and `scipy` for vector and matrix operations,
`nibabel` for neuroimaging data I/O and simple manipulations, and
`click` for the CLI.

To run the `kinfitr` implementations of kinetic models, you will also need an
installation of R and the [kinfitr] R package as well as the `rpy2` Python module.

## Installation

You can install _Dynamic PET_ via [pip] after cloning the repository:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/bilgelm/dynamicpet.git
$ pip install -e dynamicpet
```

## Usage

Please see the [Usage] for details on the CLI.

## Example

CLI usage is illustrated below on a dynamic PET dataset available on [OpenNeuro].

First, download the [NRM2018 PET Grand Challenge Dataset](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds001705/versions/1.0.1/download).
You will then need to create a binary mask that is in the same space as the PET image that defines the reference region. The full path to this binary mask will be referred to as `REFMASK`. Generally, the reference region is defined on a structural MRI and then mapped onto the PET via image registration and transformation.

After installing _Dynamic PET_ as described above, execute:

```console
$ kineticmodel PET REFMASK --model SRTMZhou2003 --outputdir <OUTPUTDIR> --fwhm 5
```

where

```console
$ PET=<OPENNEURODATA>/ds001705-download/sub-000101/ses-baseline/pet/sub-000101_ses-baseline_pet.nii
```

Before running these commands, replace
`<OPENNEURODATA>` with the path to the directory where you downloaded the data from OpenNeuro and
`<OUTPUTDIR>` with path to the directory where you'd like to save the parametric images.

_Note:_ Aside from SUVR and SRTMZhou2003, the remaining kinetic model implementations are very time consuming and are not recommended for imaging data.

## Future

Future plans for expanding the scope of _Dynamic PET_ include:

- more kinetic models and implementations
- support for surface (i.e., vertex-wise) analysis
- parallel processing
