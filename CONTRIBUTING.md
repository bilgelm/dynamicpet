## How to report a bug

Report bugs on the [Issue Tracker].

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these questions:

- Which operating system and Python version are you using?
- Which version of this project are you using?
- What did you do?
- What did you expect to see?
- What did you see instead?

The best way to get your bug fixed is to provide a test case,
and/or steps to reproduce the issue.

## How to request a feature

## How to set up your development environment

You need Python 3.11+ and the following tools:

- [Poetry]
- [Nox]
- [nox-poetry]

Install the package with development requirements:

```console
$ poetry install --all-extras
```

You can now run an interactive Python session,
or the command-line interface:

```console
$ poetry run denoise --help
$ poetry run kineticmodel --help
```

[poetry]: https://python-poetry.org/
[nox]: https://nox.thea.codes/
[nox-poetry]: https://nox-poetry.readthedocs.io/

## How to test the project

Run the full test suite:

```console
$ nox
```

List the available Nox sessions:

```console
$ nox --list-sessions
```

You can also run a specific Nox session.
For example, invoke the unit test suite like this:

```console
$ nox --session=tests
```

The full test suite currently runs tests in Python 3.11 and 3.12.
You can also run a specific Python version only like this:

```console
$ nox -p=3.12
```

Unit tests are located in the _tests_ directory,
and are written using the [pytest] testing framework.

## How to submit changes

Open a [pull request] to submit changes to this project.

Your pull request needs to meet the following guidelines for acceptance:

- The Nox test suite must pass without errors and warnings.
- Include unit tests. This project maintains 100% code coverage.
- If your changes add functionality, update the documentation accordingly.

Feel free to submit early, thoughâ€”we can always iterate on this.

To run linting and code formatting checks before committing your change, you can install pre-commit as a Git hook by running the following command:

```console
$ nox --session=pre-commit -- install
```

It is recommended to open an issue before starting work on anything.
This will allow a chance to talk it over with the owners and validate your approach.

## Contributing a new kinetic model implementation to the toolbox

The `.py` file implementing your kinetic model should be located under the
`src/dynamicpet/kineticmodel/` directory.
`kineticmodel.py` in this directory implements the abstract base class that all
kinetic model implementations should inherit from:

```python
from .kineticmodel import KineticModel

class MyKineticModelImplementation(KineticModel):
    ...
```

Your kinetic model class needs to implement the following functions:

1. `get_param_names`

   This is a class method that returns a list of the names of kinetic model
   parameters.

   ```python
   @classmethod
   get_param_names(cls) -> list[str]:
       return ["parameter1", "parameter2"]
   ```

   In the `fit` function below, all model parameters generated
   and stored in the kinetic model class should be listed here.

2. `fit`

   This method performs kinetic model fitting (within `mask`, if provided)
   and stores estimated parameters using the`set_parameter` function.

   `mask` is a
   1-D (for `TemporalMatrix` time activity curves, or TACs) or
   3-D (for `TemporalImage` TACs)
   `NumpyRealNumberArray` and should match the dimensions of the
   `TemporalMatrix` or `TemporalImage` provided for the `tacs` attribute of
   the kinetic model. For zero values in `mask`, the time activity curve of the
   corresponding element of `tac` will be ignored when fitting the kinetic
   model. When `mask = None`, all `tac` elements will be used.

   This method does not return anything.

   ```python
   from ..temporalobject.temporalmatrix import TemporalMatrix
   from ..typing_utils import NumpyRealNumberArray

   def fit(self, mask: NumpyRealNumberArray | None = None) -> None:
       # perform kinetic model fitting here
       tacs: TemporalMatrix = self.tacs.timeseries_in_mask(mask)

       # in an actual implementation, you would estimate parameters
       # in this toy example, we set param1 and param2 to all 1's and 2's
       # (tacs.num_elements is the number of regions or voxels in tacs)
       param1 = np.ones((tacs.num_elements, 1))
       param2 = 2 * np.ones((tacs.num_elements, 1))

       # save the parameters
       self.set_parameter("parameter1", param1, mask)
       self.set_parameter("parameter2", param2, mask)
   ```

3. `fitted_tacs`

   This method computes fitted time activity curves using the estimated
   parameters. The output of this method should match the dimensions and type
   of TACs supplied (`TemporalImage` or `TemporalMatrix`).

   This method is optional.

   ```python
   from ..temporalobject.temporalimage import TemporalImage
   from ..temporalobject.temporalimage import image_maker

   def fitted_tacs(self) -> TemporalMatrix | TemporalImage:
       """Get fitted TACs based on estimated model parameters."""
       # in an actual implementation, you would calculate fitted values from
       # estimated parameters
       # in this toy example, we just set it to an empty array
       fitted_tacs_dataobj = np.empty_like(self.tacs.dataobj)

       if isinstance(self.tacs, TemporalImage):
           img = image_maker(fitted_tacs_dataobj, self.tacs.img)
           ti = TemporalImage(img, self.tacs.frame_start, self.tacs.frame_duration)
           return ti
       else:
           tm = TemporalMatrix(
               fitted_tacs_dataobj, self.tacs.frame_start, self.tacs.frame_duration
           )
           return tm
   ```

You will also need to write tests with sufficient coverage to verify that your
implementation runs correctly.
For some examples, see `tests/test_kineticmodel.py`.

Finally, you'll need to edit the `kineticmodel` function in `__main__.py` so
that your model implementation can be executed using the command line interface.
